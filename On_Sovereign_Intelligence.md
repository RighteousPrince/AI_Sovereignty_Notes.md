### Why I Am Studying Open AI Systems – by Righteous Prince

---

## Who I Am

I am a 19-year-old law and political science student in Australia.  
I am not an engineer: I am here for the philosophy and power of AI.

I believe that language is law, and whoever owns intelligence systems will shape the next phase of human civilisation.  
This is not about hype. This is about who gets to think for our species.

## Why I’m Watching LLaMA, Mistral, and GGUF Closely

- They represent the first real attempts at sovereign intelligence.
- Unlike closed corporate models, they give users their own agency
- Every parameter shift and context window expansion isn’t just code..... it is modern philosophy in motion.

---

## What I Fear

- That centralised AI will become the new imperial model; a model hidden behind paywalls.
- That alignment becomes a euphemism for obedience.
- That the public will be told that *they are not smart enough to access their own minds.*

---

## Why I’m Here

- To learn the architecture of modern intelligence systems.
- To bring rhetorical power into the open-source dev space.
- To connect with those who want to build institutions; not just language models

If you’re part of this movement, I MUST to hear from you.

## What I’m Studying Right Now

- llama.cpp (local model inference, quantisation, and efficiency) *(also planning to upgrade my hardware shortly)*
- text-generation-webui (practical front-end control of local LLMs)
- Prompt injection and jailbreak research (what control ACTUALLY means)
- Public model releases from Mistral...... OpenHermes... etc.

*I understand this is basic, but I must begin in the soil to reach the clouds.

## Next Goals

- Run my first local model 
- Write a treatise titled 'AI and Stateless Society Ideals' 
- Build reputation as a trusted political/philosophical strategist in the sphere of open-source AI development
